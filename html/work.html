                        <h3>Full-Stack Web Developer at Stream It, Inc.</h3>
                        <p>In October 2021, I was interviewed for a Web Developer Intern position at Stream It, Inc. At the time, the company's product website was being built with Vue.js, a framework that provides functionality similar to React or Angular. I was asked to help finish that website so the company could deploy it for product reservations and other purchases.</p>
                        <p>Now, I am one of their full-stack web developers currently focusing on redeploying their product website using Drupal. Drupal is an open-source content management software (CMS) that helps reduce time in manually writing code and allows for simple layout design and eCommerce integration.</p>
                        <p>The website I am building is for the company's main flag-ship product: <a href="https://cyberlandr.com/" target="_blank" class="link">CyberLandr</a><sup>TM</sup>. CyberLandr<sup>TM</sup> is designed to transform Tesla's new Cybertruck into the ultimate lifestyle vehicle, allowing customers to travel all sorts of terrain. No matter where the adventurer travels or wanders, CyberLandr<sup>TM</sup> will always provide the comforts of home currently missed in the RV industry today.</p>
